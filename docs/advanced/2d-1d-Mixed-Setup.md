## Overview

WLED  supports mixing 2D and 1D setup on the same unit , the expected result is that you could use 2D fixture  and still chain a strip after or setup a strip and then a matrix  .

Setup your leds count in  Config, LED Preferences as ususal , for example 8x8 matrix and a strip of 30 pixles chaind at the end of your matrix  , total count should be 64 + 30 =94  .

Go to  Config , 2D setup page and create a 8x8 matrix ,and then go to the segments , the 8x8 segments should be created automaticaly  , for the strip  if you enter a start pixel beyond the matrix  into second segment  then it will  change into 1D segment  same as this example

Note: If the the matrix is chaind after the strip then use reversing at the bus level, i.e check Reversed (rotated 180Â°) in LED & Hardware setup
